# A Variable Gaussian Kernel Scale Active Contour Model Based on Jeffreys Divergence for ICT Image Segmentation
This repository contains MATLAB implementations for the paper: A Variable Gaussian Kernel Scale Active Contour Model Based on Jeffreys Divergence for ICT Image Segmentation.
# Abstract
In industrial computed tomography (ICT), factors like beam scattering, insufficient beam intensity, and detector dark current often lead to weak edges, scattering artifacts, and severe Gaussian noise in ICT images. These issues pose significant difficulties for accurate segmentation of high-density complex structures using existing active contour models (ACMs). To address these limitations, this paper presents a variable Gaussian kernel scale active contour model based on Jeffreys divergence (VGJD). Firstly, the Jeffreys divergence (JD) is incorporated into the energy function to replace the conventional Euclidean distance, enhancing the contour’s ability to quantify pixel value disparity during evolution. Additionally, a filter weight is introduced to minimize the impact of noise. Moreover, a variable Gaussian kernel scale strategy is adopted to effectively integrate both global and local image information, thereby enhancing the robustness of the initial contour and improving the precision of detail segmentation. Finally, optimized length and regularity terms are employed to enforce constraints on the level set function. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the VGJD model can effectively segment various complex ICT images, achieving superior precision in comparison to other ACM models.
# Highlights
1. The JD is introduced to construct the energy function based on the LIC model, which better measures the disparity between the fitted image and the real image, thereby enhancing the efficacy of the model. Additionally, an image filter weight is added to better suppress noise interference in ICT images.
2. A variation function for the Gaussian kernel scale parameter is formulated to effectively leverage both global and local image information. This enables the segmentation contour to rapidly converge towards the target region while maintaining the ability for precise segmentation, thereby enhancing the robustness of the initial contour.
3. The length term, regularization term, and driving function of the model are refined to constrain the level set function with the range of [–1, 1]. This increases the steepness of the level set function near the zero level set and further improves segmentation accuracy.
